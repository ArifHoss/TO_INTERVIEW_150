# Intuition
When first tackling this problem, we should recognize it as a cycle detection problem in disguise. The process of squaring and summing a number's digits can repeat, leading either to the happy result of '1' or a cycle that never reaches '1'. My first thought is to use a data structure to keep track of the sums we've computed so far to detect a cycle.

# Approach
The approach to solving this problem is iterative:

* Compute the sum of the squares of the digits of the current number.
* Check if this new sum is '1', which means we have a happy number.
* If the sum is not '1', check if we have seen this sum before using a set. If we have, then a cycle is detected, and the number is not happy.
* If we have not seen the sum before, add it to the set of seen sums and repeat the process with the new sum.

# Complexity
* Time complexity: The time complexity of this algorithm is not straightforward to determine because it depends on the number of times we need to sum the squares of the digits until we either find 1 or detect a cycle. In the worst-case scenario, it could potentially be high for numbers that lead to long sequences before repeating. However, the time complexity can be bounded by a constant since we know that the sequence must eventually either hit 1 or enter a loop. The constant is hard to define but is related to the number of distinct sums that can be created from the digits of any number. Therefore, we can consider the time complexity to be 0(243â‹…3+log n+log log n+log log log n) which simplifies to 0(log n) since the series converges and the dominant term is the number of digits in 'n'.

* Space complexity: The space complexity of the algorithm is O(log n)O(logn) since in the worst case, the set of seen sums could store a number of unique sums up to the number of digits in the original number 'n'. Each digit can contribute at most a square of 9 (i.e., 81) to the sum, and the sum itself can have at most log 'n' digits.

# Code
```
class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        Set<Integer> seenNumbers = new HashSet<>();

        while(n != 1 && !seenNumbers.contains(n)){
            seenNumbers.add(n);

            int sumOfSquares = 0;            
            while(n != 0){
                int lastDigits = n % 10;
                sumOfSquares += (lastDigits * lastDigits);
                n /= 10; 
            }
            n = sumOfSquares;
        }
        return n == 1;
    }
}
